# 🐍 Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## 🎯 AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.

---

## 💻 Program :

        class Rectangle:
          length = 0 
          breadth = 0
          def __init__(self):
              self.length = 5
              self.breadth = 3
              print(self.length)
              print(self.breadth)
      
      obj = Rectangle()


## Output :
<img width="348" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cf1b487-29ec-4525-aa93-1329f57a0db2" />

## Result :
Thus, the python program is executed successfully.
